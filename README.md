# GMTK 2023 Game Jam
This is a unity project for use with **Unity3D LTS Release 2022.3.4f1**. 

## Git/Unity Usage Rules
Follow these golden rules and dairykillsme won't kill you

1. Only commit files you meant to change. If I see any `git commit .` I will be angey.
2. Use branches.
3. Make prefabs of objects whenever possible. This make tracking things in git and reuse of assets much easier
4. If you are prototyping something (not designing a real level), make a prototyping scene named something like `george_prototyping.scene`
